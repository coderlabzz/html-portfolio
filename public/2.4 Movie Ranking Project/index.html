<h1>The Best Cyberpunk Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<u><h3>1. Blade Runner 2049</h3></u>
<p>This movie is best live action cyberpunk film I have seen to date. It improves on the great visual style of the first Blade Runner movie and has a great story with good plot twists</p>
<u><h3>2. Akira 1988</h3></u>
<p>A great animated film with everything thing you would expect from a good cyberpunk movie. The movie is set in a futuristic Hong Kong and has the gritty high tech low life visual style. It has a good story and lots of good action and it explores many philosophical subjects such as tranhumanism and consciousness</p>
<u><h3>3. The Matrix</h3></u>
<p>This is a great movie that explores many philosophical themes. The story is great and has lots of great action scenes.</p>
